# Contributing Guidelines

Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged! :octocat:

## 📝 Overview

- `src/novelai_python/utils` should only contain **utility** functions **for** other modules. Tool **interfaces** are
  not allowed to be placed in this directory.

## 📦 Branching

- `main` is the default branch.
- `dev` is the development branch.

We work on the `dev` branch and create pull requests to merge into `main`.
